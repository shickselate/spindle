**KAIron Theta UNDER ATTACK: CIVILIAN HABITATS FLATTENED**

In a surprise strike, Norg Syndicate ships bombarded Kairon Theta at dawn today, targeting civilian habitats in Zone 3. No warning was issued prior to the attack. Eyewitnesses describe the destruction as indiscriminate, with structures reduced to rubble. Field correspondent Lira Mekk narrowly escaped: "They weren't aiming at defenses. They were punishing the ground." Norg officials claim the strike was necessary for "strategic asset denial," but the motives behind the attack remain unclear. Casualties are unknown at this time.
