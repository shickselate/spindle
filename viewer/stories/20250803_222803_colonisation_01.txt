**ZS-LUMEN TOUCHES DOWN ON ELYON IV**

In a major breakthrough for intergalactic colonization efforts, the ZS-Lumen landing module successfully touched down on Elyon IV's equatorial plateau at 19:20 hours today. Initial scans indicate significant resource viability, paving the way for the establishment of a new human settlement. The habitat module and resource scanner have been deployed, with atmospheric conditions stabilizing within acceptable tolerances. As of now, no contact has been made with local fauna.
