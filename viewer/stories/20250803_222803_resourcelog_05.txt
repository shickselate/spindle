**KARNIS REFINARY CRISIS: ANTIMATTER RESERVES DROPPING FAST**

A crisis is unfolding at the Karnis Refinery, as internal records reveal that antimatter reserves have plummeted below critical levels. The incident occurred at 21:10. All backup stores are now depleted, leaving the facility on the brink of complete shutdown within two cycles. The situation has sparked a sense of urgency among logistics officials, who are recommending either rerouting synthesis from the Braxil Ring or suspending jump operations to mitigate the impact. Efforts are underway to address the crisis and restore stable antimatter production.
