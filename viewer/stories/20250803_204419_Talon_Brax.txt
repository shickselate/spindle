**MOONBASE QUARN - PEACE REAFFIRMED FOLLOWING TWIN MOONS ECLIPSE EVENT**

A rare celestial event unfolded on the gas giant moon of Quarn yesterday, as the Twin Moons underwent a spectacular eclipse. The neutral enclave, long plagued by tensions and strife, was host to an unexpected guest: Talon Brax, Engineer of Nomads of Icarus. Brax's presence proved instrumental in resolving complications that arose during the eclipse, ultimately reaffirming peace in the region.
